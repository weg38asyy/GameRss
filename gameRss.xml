However, Capcom has announced a surprise Street Fighter 6 open beta test, which will run May 19-21. &lt;br&gt; The open beta will feature all of the content from the second closed beta test, which took place just before the holidays on December 16-19. That test centered around the Battle Hub, Street Fighter 6's online lobby where players could customize characters, challenge each other to matches, or play classic Capcom games via in-game arcade cabinets. &lt;br&gt; You've all been asking!Play the Open Beta for #StreetFighter6 from May 19-21. Experience the content from Closed Beta Test #2, including 8 characters and various ways to play online!🌐 https://t.co/cUsf8PXM5j pic.twitter.com/HhlqCDCCA4 &lt;br&gt; The roster for the open beta will also be the same as the second closed beta test, with a list of playable characters that includes the following: &lt;br&gt; The surprise open beta follows the launch of Street Fighter 6 Demo Version, which gave players a taste of the game's World Tour story mode. Characters created in the demo will carry over to the full game when it launches next month, but those created in the open beta will not. &lt;br&gt; Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. The open beta test will be available to download for free on all platforms the game is releasing for except PlayStation 4 beginning May 19.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;詳細句子文法解析：&lt;br&gt;1. "After two closed beta tests and a recent demo launch, Street Fighter fans might have thought there'd be no more chances to play the next installment before its June 2 launch." &lt;br&gt;   → "might have thought there'd be no more chances to play" 為過去式可能條件句，表示對過去已經沒有機會進行的情況做出的推論。&lt;br&gt;2. "However, Capcom has announced a surprise Street Fighter 6 open beta test, which will run May 19-21."&lt;br&gt;   → 使用"which"而非"that"來引導從句，因為從句不限定主句中的名詞，而只是提供了更多的信息。&lt;br&gt;3. "The open beta will feature all of the content from the second closed beta test, which took place just before the holidays on December 16-19."&lt;br&gt;   → "which took place just before the holidays on December 16-19." 為非限定性定語從句，修飾前面的second closed beta test，提供進一步的細節。&lt;br&gt;4. "That test centered around the Battle Hub, Street Fighter 6's online lobby where players could customize characters, challenge each other to matches, or play classic Capcom games via in-game arcade cabinets."&lt;br&gt;   →使用"that"而非"which"來引導從句，因為從句限定了主句中的名詞"That test"。&lt;br&gt;5. "You've all been asking!"&lt;br&gt;   → 感嘆句，表示驚訝、歡樂、怒氣等多種情緒。&lt;br&gt;6. "The roster for the open beta will also be the same as the second closed beta test, with a list of playable characters that includes the following:"&lt;br&gt;   → 前面的整句已經提到open beta，在這個句子中可以縮減，使用省略句。&lt;br&gt;7. "The surprise open beta follows the launch of Street Fighter 6 Demo Version, which gave players a taste of the game's World Tour story mode."&lt;br&gt;   → "which gave players a taste of the game's World Tour story mode." 為非限定性定語從句，修飾前面的Street Fighter 6 Demo Version，提供進一步的細節。&lt;br&gt;8. "Characters created in the demo will carry over to the full game when it launches next month, but those created in the open beta will not."&lt;br&gt;   → 含有兩個並列連詞"but"，表達出兩個對等的事實。&lt;br&gt;9. "Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. The open beta test will be available to download for free on all platforms the game is releasing for except PlayStation 4 beginning May 19."&lt;br&gt;   → 使用了前補語加行為主詞的結構，明確表明了兩件事情的同時發生和不同的對象。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;單字：&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. closed beta test (封閉式Beta測試) - "closed"表示限制，只有受邀請的人能參加，"beta test"表示測試階段。&lt;br&gt;   C:開放式β測試(open beta test)   J:クローズドβテスト&lt;br&gt;2. demo (試玩版本) - 簡化版的遊戲，用來讓玩家知道遊戲風格，評估是否購買正式版。&lt;br&gt;   C:預覽版(preview)   J:体験版(taikenban)&lt;br&gt;3. roster (角色列表) - 遊戲中可選擇的角色名單。&lt;br&gt;   C:人物選單(character selection)   J:ロースター(ro-suta-)&lt;br&gt;4. arcade (遊戲廳) - 遊戲機設置在其中的室內遊戲場所。&lt;br&gt;   C:電子遊戲中心(electronic game center)   J:ゲームセンター(gemusenta-)&lt;br&gt;5. installments (系列作品) - 由多部分組成的長程作品。&lt;br&gt;   C:系列文章(serial articles)   J:シリーズ作品(shirizu sakuhin)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. challenge (挑戰) - 測試某人的技能或力量。&lt;br&gt;   C:挑戰者(challenger)   J:挑戦(teki)&lt;br&gt;7. content (內容) - 包括應用程序、遊戲、文件等的任何內容。&lt;br&gt;   C:內涵(connotation)   J:内容(naiyou)&lt;br&gt;8. launch (發行) - 推出新產品、服務或專案。&lt;br&gt;   C:上市(release)   J:ローンチ(ronchi)&lt;br&gt;9. lobby (大廳) - 在遊戲中的一個地方，玩家可以自由地探索，挑戰和聯機。&lt;br&gt;   C:集合區(gathering area)   J:ロビー(robi-)&lt;br&gt;10. carry over (轉移) - 從一個地方移動資源或項目到另一個地方。&lt;br&gt;     C:繼承(inherit)   J:キャリーオーバー(kyari-oba-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;片語：&lt;br&gt;1. 相似片語： &lt;br&gt;   - play a part（扮演角色）            play the game（玩遊戲）&lt;br&gt;2. 反義片語：&lt;br&gt;   - closed beta test（封閉式Beta測試） vs open beta test（公開式Beta測試）&lt;br&gt;   - carry over（轉移） vs start from scratch（從零開始）</content><link href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/street-fighter-6-open-beta-coming-later-this-month-will-feature-8-characters/1100-6513925/" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
