Additionally, there are 10-player co-op missions and weekly five-player missions with global leaderboards. &lt;br&gt; Prized Test Subjects!The #Exoprimal development team has an exciting new update about content coming in the full game, including:🦖Missions without direct PvP🦖10-player co-op missions🦖Exosuit variants &amp; ability customization🦖And more!Full info: https://t.co/JFG2ItwtXF pic.twitter.com/XdzpmwjvCH &lt;br&gt; The Dino Survival mode will also include story missions, cutscenes, and a map where players can learn more about the Leviathan, the evil AI, and multiple parallel worlds. As for the customization options, players can equip Modules to use various Exosuit abilities and cosmetic ones like Exosuit and weapon skins, decals, and emotes. &lt;br&gt; Exoprimal will receive post-launch support through Exosuit variants with alternate fire and playstyles, as well as collaborations with other Capcom titles. &lt;br&gt; Exoprimal is set to launch on July 14, 2023, for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It will also be released on Xbox Game Pass on release day. In GameSpot's Exoprimal preview, we said, "Exoprimal is a surprisingly fun and smart team-based shooter with a lot that works--it'll be fascinating to see just how well the game works when all its components are offered to players."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;詳細句子文法解析：&lt;br&gt;1. Capcom has revealed some new details about the different kinds of game modes, story content, and customization options that players can look forward to with the full release of Exoprimal.&lt;br&gt;→主詞為Capcom，動詞為revealed，新聞報導中用過去完成式表示已經公布的事情，其中名詞片語有 the different kinds of game modes, story content, and customization options. 介系詞片語 that players can look forward to是修飾details的定語，with the full release of Exoprimal是修飾整個名詞片語的副詞片語。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. While the game's open beta only consisted of a select group of missions from Dino Survival Mode, the full game will feature missions without direct PvP combat in which players can complete PvE objectives to win.&lt;br&gt;→While引導時間狀語從句，表示一種對比或轉折情況，主詞為the game's open beta，一般過去式consisted of表示過去正在進行的動作，其中consisted of a select group of missions from Dino Survival Mode為主要修飾部分，意思為透露這個測試版本中僅有少數的Dino Survival Mode任務。接下來的一個"，"表示整個前半段是引導，主句的主詞為全名詞子句the full game，will feature是將來簡單式的動詞，missons為主詞。in which承接的全是游戲任務的資訊，其中in which players can complete PvE objectives是定語，表示玩家可通過完成PvE目標來獲勝。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Additionally, there are 10-player co-op missions and weekly five-player missions with global leaderboards.&lt;br&gt;→主詞為there，副詞Additionally表示此句資訊附加前文，are為動詞，10-player co-op missions and weekly five-player missions with global leaderboards數量多的是missions，表示有一個額外遊戲模式，意即10人合作模式和全球排行的周五模式。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. The Dino Survival mode will also include story missions, cutscenes, and a map where players can learn more about the Leviathan, the evil AI, and multiple parallel worlds.&lt;br&gt;→主詞為the Dino Survival mode，動詞為will include，一系列任務、過場動畫和地圖是反串修飾，其中where引導的定語從句中Leviathan, the evil AI, and multiple parallel worlds是玩家可以在這張地圖上進一步了解的東西。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. As for the customization options, players can equip Modules to use various Exosuit abilities and cosmetic ones like Exosuit and weapon skins, decals, and emotes.&lt;br&gt;→As for是一個表示及其簡單的引導語，其中主詞為players，can equit是情態+動詞的簡單式，接下來的不同類型的任務更換武器和換裝是裝置，功能也分為 能力、化學裝飾品和自訂裝飾品，最後sekins, tlees和emotes也是相應裝飾品的三種類型。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. Exoprimal will receive post-launch support through Exosuit variants with alternate fire and playstyles, as well as collaborations with other Capcom titles.&lt;br&gt;→主詞為Exoprimal，will receive是主動語態的將來簡單形態，post-launch support是由through介系詞短語執行的概念，which is Exosuit variants with alternate fire and playstyles 大幅度縮小了讀者對該概念的不確定性，，以及collaborations with other Capcom titles後續仍需提供了解。 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;單字：&lt;br&gt;1. Exoprimal - 實名,無中文含義&lt;br&gt;2. beta - 測試版&lt;br&gt;3. PvP - 玩家對玩家，即點對點&lt;br&gt;4. PvE - 玩家對環境，即電腦控制的&lt;br&gt;5. co-op - 合作模式&lt;br&gt;6. leaderboard - 排行榜&lt;br&gt;7. Leviathan - 利維坦,巨型戰國艦船的美國名&lt;br&gt;8. AI - 人工智能&lt;br&gt;9. post-launch - 上市後支援&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;片語：&lt;br&gt;1. direct PvP combat - 直接玩家對玩家的戰鬥&lt;br&gt;→相似片語: indirect PvP combat間接的玩家對玩家的衝突&lt;br&gt;2. weekly five-player missions - 每週五名玩家的任務&lt;br&gt;→相似片語： daily solo missions 每天單人任務&lt;br&gt;→反義片語： random multiplayer missions 隨機多人組織任務</content><link href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-reveals-exoprimal-launch-details-including-story-missions-and-cosmetics/1100-6513287/" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
